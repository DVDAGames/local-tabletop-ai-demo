# Gygax AI

This is a very limited, very basic, and very incomplete implementation of a simple AI bot for Fifth Edition and other tabletop games.

We'll load in the SRD in Markdown from [https://github.com/OldManUmby/DND.SRD.Wiki.git](https://github.com/OldManUmby/DND.SRD.Wiki.git) and then load a few documents into a local Chroma database to power the retrieval augmentation for our bot.

**Note**: These docs were generated by the NextJS scaffolding tool. Gygax is not ready for anyone else to play with just yet.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
